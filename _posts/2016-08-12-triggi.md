## Triggi

About this project

Opportunity  
A truly connected Internet of Things, that's the promise of start-up Triggi. By connecting smart devices to other devices, apps and services, Triggi makes them even smarter. Triggi offers a service that make them work together seamlessly.

Challenge  
A new identity and interface for an IoT newbie with big goals.

Triggi's team of tool tinkerers and techies partnered with us to create a truly unique identity and experience. By looking at the characteristics of Triggi -functional, relevant, easy to use and fun- we created values for a visual identity and user experience.

Our partnership yielded a brand brief, branded logo, visual toolkit, responsive design for tablets and desktops, and a communications strategy. We even thought of a tagline for future campaigns: Triggi, what's your trigg?

Result  
A distinctive Triggi language which seamlessly blends with the online web service that Triggi aims to be: a big contributor to our future of connectedness.
