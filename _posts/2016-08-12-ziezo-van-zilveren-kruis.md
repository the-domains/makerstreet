About this project

Opportunity  
Zilveren Kruis and Makerstreet have been working together for years, and we're really proud of that. So when we were given the opportunity to create a whole new brand for them, we didn't think twice and got to work.

Insight  
Building a new insurance brand isn't an easy task. It takes a lot of stakeholders on various levels to agree on a plethora of different choices. To make sure we were able to do so, we worked together in one team. Our Makers and our client's specialists joined hands in an Agile process to make choices and validate them with end users/customers. By working this way we perfected the art of Scrum and applied it to a much wider application than just digital production.

Solution  
Agile everything!

From the first conceptual sketches to the final detailing strokes of the entire branding. From the first prototype to final product. And from innovation to marketing we did it all in one team. Maximising stakeholder buy-in and flexibility whilst maintaining a very short time to market and incredible attention to detail.

Result  
A striking contemporary online health insurance that has surpassed all expectations in regard to conversion, service and sales execution. Not only a commercial success, but also applauded among Makers.
