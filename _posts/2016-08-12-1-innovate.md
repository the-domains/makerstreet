  Seeing sparks? That means we’re going to build a ‘rocket’ together, the Agile
  way. Using our expertise in things like lean product development, innovation
  acceleration and corporate innovation, we strategise, execute and then
  validate our spark. If it passes our standards we move on to the next level.
  If we change our minds (it happens) we go back the necessary steps.
