  The six agencies that form Makerstreet are a well-chosen bunch of oddballs
  (meant in the most complimentary way of course). We’re all different, yet not
  too strange, and we actually take pride in being relatively normal. No
  hipsters and no ego’s.

The six agencies that form Makerstreet are a well-chosen bunch of oddballs (meant in the most complimentary way of course). We're all different, yet not too strange, and we actually take pride in being relatively normal. No hipsters and no ego's.

It's the mixture of unique and fine tuned skills paired with the vibrant cultures of each of our agencies. This enables Makerstreet to work as well as it does. Just like when building a rocket, you have to bring in The Pro's to make it fly. Leave an essential skill out and it could explode in your face...

The team might include Resoluut for some design expertise, or Mister Koreander for the art of the written word. We are all on the same street (in the same building even). And we are always lending tools and handing down advice to construct a 'rocket' that not only flies - but that soars.   
The Makers do the making, and the experts in your business (that's you) provide the insight.   
We work together to get the job done. Easy.
